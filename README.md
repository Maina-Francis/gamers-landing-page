# Gaming Website Landing Page

Welcome to the landing page for a gaming website built using React! This project is a simple web application that requires users to enter their email address and password to login. If the user does not exist in the system, an error page is displayed. The UI was [designed using Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/w2XPHexCfFbH25a8CbXfjW/Gamers-Site-Login-Page?node-id=2%3A112&t=jkPv8ZsfoYhbSFN8-1), with HTML5, CSS3, React, and JavaScript being used to build the app.
